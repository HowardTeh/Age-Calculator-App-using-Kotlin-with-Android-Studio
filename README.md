# Age-Calculator-App-using-Kotlin-with-Android-Studio

This application is created to help people to calculate their age in terms of days and minutes based on their birth date. The user can select his/her date of birth 
from the date picker dialog to calculate the age in days and minutes respectively.

I created this application while I am learning Kotlin with Android Studio, kindly have a good look on it and let me know how should I improve to be a bettter Android Developer!

Wish you guys have a nice day! Peace ya!
